classdef lsl_inlet < handle
	% A stream inlet.
	% Inlets are used to receive streaming data (and meta-data) from the lab network.
    %
    % Note:
    %   Most functions of the inlet can throw an error of type 'lsl:lost_error' if the stream
    %   read by this inlet has been lost irretrievably. Those functions that take a timeout can in
    %   addition throw an error of type 'lsl:timeout_error'.

            %   Streaminfo : A resolved stream info object (as coming from one of the lsl_resolve_* functions).
            %
            %   MaxBuffered : Optionally the maximum amount of data to buffer (in seconds if there is a nominal
            %				  sampling rate, otherwise x100 in samples). Recording applications want to use a fairly
            %				  large buffer size here, while real-time applications would only buffer as much as
            %				  they need to perform their next calculation. (default: 360)
            %   
            %   ChunkSize : Optionally the maximum size, in samples, at which chunks are transmitted
            %				(0 corresponds to the chunk sizes used by the sender).
            %				Recording applications can use a generous size here (leaving it to the network how
            %				to pack things), while real-time applications may want a finer (perhaps 1-sample) granularity.
            %               (default 0)
            %

            %			  In all other cases (recover is false or the stream is not recoverable) functions may throw a
            %			  lost_error if the stream's source is lost (e.g., due to an app or computer crash).
