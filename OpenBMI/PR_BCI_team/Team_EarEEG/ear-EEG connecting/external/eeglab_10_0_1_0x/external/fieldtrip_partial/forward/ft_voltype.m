function [type] = ft_voltype(vol, desired)

% FT_VOLTYPE determines the type of volume conduction model
%
% Use as
%   [type] = ft_voltype(vol)
% to get a string describing the type, or
%   [flag] = ft_voltype(vol, desired)
% to get a boolean value.
%
% The volume conduction model types that are recognized are
%
%  singlesphere    analytical single sphere model for EEG or MEG
%  multisphere     local spheres model for MEG, one sphere per channel
%  concentric      analytical 4-sphere model for EEG
%  infinite        infinite homogenous medium
%  bem             boundary element model, can be any of the methods below
%  openmeeg        boundary element method based on the OpenMEEG implementation
%  bemcp           boundary element method based on the implementation from Christophe Phillips
%  dipoli          boundary element method based on the implementation from Thom Oostendorp
%  asa             boundary element method based on the (commercial) ASA software
