function numbers = ft_poll_buffer(filename, thresholds, timeout)
% FT_POLL_BUFFER polls the FieldTrip buffer described by 'filename' for
% the number of events and samples. You can also use this function to
% wait up to a given amount of milliseconds until the number of samples
% OR the number of events present in the buffer is bigger than a specified
% threshold. The output of this function is a struct with elements
% 'nsamples' and 'nevents', that always contain the current quantities.
% (So in case of timeouts, these might be smaller than the thresholds).
%
% Examples
% --------
% The following will immediately return the two quantities:
% >> numbers = ft_poll_buffer('buffer://localhost:1972');
%
% The following will wait up to 50 milliseconds for more than 100 samples in the buffer.
%   thr = []; thr.nsamples = 100; timeout = 50;
%   numbers = ft_poll_buffer('buffer://localhost:1972', thr, timeout);
%
% The following will wait up to 80 milliseconds for more than 30 events in the buffer.
%   thr = []; thr.nevents = 30; timeout = 80;
%   numbers = ft_poll_buffer('buffer://localhost:1972', thr, timeout);
%
% Repeatedly wait for new data (either samples or events):
%
%   lastNum = []; 
%   lastNum.nevents = 0; 
%   lastNum.nsamples = 0; 
%   timeout = 100;
%   while someCriterion
%      newNum = ft_poll_buffer('buffer://localhost:1972', lastNum, timeout);
%      if newNum.nsamples > lastNum.nsamples
%         ... read and process samples ...
%      if newNum.nevents > lastNum.nevents
%         ... read and process events ...
%      lastNum = newNum;
%   end
