function [ws warned] = warning_once(varargin)
%
% Use as
%  warning_once(string)
% or
%  warning_once(string, timeout)
% or
%  warning_once(id, string, timeout)
% where timeout should be inf if you don't want to see the warning ever
% again. The default timeout value is 60 seconds.
%
% Can be used instead of the MATLAB built-in function WARNING, thus as
%  s = warning_once(...)
% or
%  warning_once(s) 
% where s is a structure with fields 'identifier' and 'state', storing the
% state information.
% In other words, warning_once accepts as an input the same structure it 
% returns as an output. This returns or restores the states of warnings to 
% their previous values.
%
% Can also be used as
%  [s w] = warning_once(...)
% where w is a boolean that indicates whether a warning as been
% thrown or not.
