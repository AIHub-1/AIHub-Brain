This is the BCI2000import plugin for EEGLAB, written by J. Adam Wilson of Univ. Wisconsin and part of the BCI2000 distribution.
It also contains the BCI2000 .dat importer that comes with BCI2000, (C) 2000-2008, BCI2000 Project. See also www.bci2000.org.

The import plugin code has been slightly extended for use from EEGLAB/BCILAB scripts and with BCILAB's unified importer.
