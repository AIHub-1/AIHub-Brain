# matlab_Kinovaapi_wrapper
a Matlab wrapper on the Kinova API

please see README text file in matlab_Kinovaapi_wrapper/JACO2Communicator/

my personal testing experience:
- had to connect the jaco arm to the usb port I usually use (where the driver is installed)
- had to recompile the mex file on my computer (I am not using Windows 10 with Matlab 2017, I am rather on Windows 7 64 bits with Matlab 2016a)
- had to close matlab
- had to open it again
- had to add JACO2Communicator folder and subfolder to the path
- had to run testJacoComm.m from the folder C:\Users\mblouin\Desktop\JACO2Communicator\JACO2SDK
- it works!
