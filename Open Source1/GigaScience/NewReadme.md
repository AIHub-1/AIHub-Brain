# Gigascience Repository - README

## Overview

Welcome to the Gigascience repository, home to comprehensive and robust code for EEG signal analysis, specifically focusing on ERP (Event-Related Potential), MI (Motor Imagery), and SSVEP (Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential) methods.

The code snippets shared here are meticulously designed to aid researchers and practitioners in the field of neuroscience, signal processing, and brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Our aim is to provide a valuable resource that can simplify the process of EEG data processing and analysis.

## Code Structure

The codebase is neatly organized into multiple versions, each catering to a specific method of EEG signal analysis: ERP, MI, and SSVEP.

1. **ERP Version**: Event-Related Potential (ERP) is a measured brain response that is a direct result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event. The ERP version of the code focuses on the processing and analysis of these brain signals.

2. **MI Version**: Motor Imagery (MI) involves the mental simulation of a physical action. The MI version of the code is devoted to the analysis of brain signals elicited during motor imagery tasks.

3. **SSVEP Version**: Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) refers to the natural response of the brain from visual stimulation at specific frequencies. The SSVEP version of the code is dedicated to the analysis of these types of brain signals.

## How To Use

Each version of the code initiates with the preprocessing of EEG data, including resampling, channel selection, and filtering based on specific frequency bands. The code then segments the preprocessed data based on defined intervals and applies a baseline correction.

Following preprocessing, features are extracted from the segmented data, reshaped, and used to train a classifier. This trained classifier is then utilized to predict characters from unseen data in the context of a spelling task.

The code includes meticulous performance evaluation sections, which calculate the accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) of the predictions. 

Finally, a visualization portion of the code allows for the generation of relevant plots to help with the interpretation of results.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive into the code, ensure that you have your EEG data available in the appropriate format as specified in the code. The code is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing for customization based on your specific research needs.

## Conclusion

We hope this resource will be beneficial to your EEG research and signal processing needs. The codes are designed to be straightforward and customizable, and we welcome any contributions or suggestions for improvements. We are looking forward to seeing the incredible research you will conduct with the help of this repository.

## Disclaimer

This codebase is provided as-is, and while we strive to keep it up-to-date and bug-free, we recommend users to cross-verify with the latest research and best practices in the field of EEG signal analysis.
