% std_chaninds() - look up channel indices in a STUDY
%
% Usage:
%         >> inds = std_chaninds(STUDY,  channames);
%         >> inds = std_chaninds(EEG, channames);
% Inputs:
%         STUDY - studyset structure containing a changrp substructure.
%     channames - [cell] channel names
%
% Outputs:
%       inds - [integer array] channel indices
