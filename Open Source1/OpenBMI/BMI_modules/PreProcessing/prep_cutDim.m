%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% prep_cutDim (Pre-processing procedure):
%
% Synopsis:
%     [out] = prep_cutDim(DAT)
%
% Example :
%     [out] = prep_cutDim(epoched_data)%    
%
% Arguments:
%     dat - Structure. Segmented data structure, or the data matrix itself
%           (Result will be same as input when the data is continuous)   
%           
% Returns:
%     out - Stacked data with reduced dimensionality
%
% Description:
%     This function reduces dimensionality of the data, reducing all
%     dimensions except for the trial dimension.
%     epoched data should be [time * channels * trials]
%     reduced data form would be [1 * 2, 3] --> '2-dimension'
