OpenBMI-master
This open software package is dedicated to the development of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and includes various advanced pattern recognition algorithms. It consists of several modules and example codes for Motor Imagination (MI), Event-Related Potential (ERP), and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). The package also includes detailed implementation functions in 'BMI_modules', Graphic User Interface (GUI) functions, Psychtoolbox-based paradigm functions, codes from the GigaScience paper, and other BCI group's codes. There is a demo available under 'VIS', a test mat file, and codes from the TNNLS paper. For more information or questions, visit the OpenBMI website at http://openbmi.org.
