<h1>🧠 OpenBMI 🧠</h1>

<h3>The open software package is designed for developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) with various advanced pattern recognition algorithms.</h3>

It includes detailed information and example codes for Motor Imagination (MI), Event-Related Potential (ERP), and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) in the 'Examples' folder.

The package also features 'BMI_modules' with implementation functions, 'GUI module' for Graphic User Interface functions, and 'Paradigm' functions using Psychtoolbox.

Additionally, it contains codes from other BCI groups and an OpenBMI demo. For questions or more information, visit http://openbmi.org.

<h3>Voice Reconstruction from Brain Signals</h3>

This repository is home to the official implementation of our novel algorithm aimed at reconstructing voice from EEG during imagined speech. 

<h3>Key Contributions</h3>
- We've developed a generative model capable of extracting frequency characteristics and sequential information from neural signals to generate speech.
- Addressed the constraint of imagined speech-based BTS system lacking ground truth voice by employing a domain adaptation method.
- Demonstrated the potential of robust speech generation by training only several words or phrases, with the model showing capability to learn phoneme level information from brain signals.
