		<b>The open software package is designed for developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) with various advanced pattern recognition algorithms.</b>
		<p>It includes detailed information and example codes for Motor Imagination (MI), Event-Related Potential (ERP), and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) in the 'Examples' folder.</p>
		<p>The package also features 'BMI_modules' with implementation functions, 'GUI module' for Graphic User Interface functions, and 'Paradigm' functions using Psychtoolbox.</p>
		<p>Additionally, it contains codes from other BCI groups and an OpenBMI demo. For questions or more information, visit http://openbmi.org.</p>

	<b>Voice Reconstruction from Brain Signals</b>
		<p>This repository is home to the official implementation of our novel algorithm aimed at reconstructing voice from EEG during imagined speech.</p>
	<b>Key Contributions</b>
		<p>- We've developed a generative model capable of extracting frequency characteristics and sequential information from neural signals to generate speech.</p>
		<p>- Addressed the constraint of imagined speech-based BTS system lacking ground truth voice by employing a domain adaptation method.</p>
		<p>- Demonstrated the potential of robust speech generation by training only several words or phrases, with the model showing capability to learn phoneme level information from brain signals.</p>

		<b>Diff-E: EEG Imagined Speech Decoding Using Diffusion-based Learning </b>
		<b>Introduction</b>
			<p>Decoding EEG signals for imagined speech has been a complex task, primarily due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and a low signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
		<b>Solution</b>
			<p>Our study introduces Diff-E, a novel method that utilizes denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and a conditional autoencoder to address these challenges.</p>
		<b>Results</b>
			<p>We've found that Diff-E substantially outperforms traditional machine learning techniques and baseline models in terms of decoding accuracy.</p> 
		<b>Implications</b>
			<p>These findings indicate the potential effectiveness of DDPMs for EEG signal decoding, suggesting possible applications in the development of brain-computer interfaces that enable communication 				through imagined speech.</p> 
		<b>Status</b>
		<p>This work is currently under review for presentation at Interspeech 2023.</p>
