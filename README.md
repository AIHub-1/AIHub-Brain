The package also features 'BMI_modules' with implementation functions, 'GUI module' for Graphic User Interface functions, and 'Paradigm' functions using Psychtoolbox. Additionally, it contains codes from other BCI groups and an OpenBMI demo. For questions or more information, visit http://openbmi.org.
