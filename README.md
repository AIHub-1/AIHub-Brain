<h3>The open software package is designed for developing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) with various advanced pattern recognition algorithms.</h3>

<p>It includes detailed information and example codes for Motor Imagination (MI), Event-Related Potential (ERP), and Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) in the 'Examples' folder.</p>

<p>The package also features 'BMI_modules' with implementation functions, 'GUI module' for Graphic User Interface functions, and 'Paradigm' functions using Psychtoolbox.</p>

<p>Additionally, it contains codes from other BCI groups and an OpenBMI demo. For questions or more information, visit http://openbmi.org.</p>

<h3>Voice Reconstruction from Brain Signals</h3>

<p>This repository is home to the official implementation of our novel algorithm aimed at reconstructing voice from EEG during imagined speech.</p>

<h3>Key Contributions</h3>
<p>- We've developed a generative model capable of extracting frequency characteristics and sequential information from neural signals to generate speech.</p>
<p>- Addressed the constraint of imagined speech-based BTS system lacking ground truth voice by employing a domain adaptation method.</p>
<p>- Demonstrated the potential of robust speech generation by training only several words or phrases, with the model showing capability to learn phoneme level information from brain signals.</p>
