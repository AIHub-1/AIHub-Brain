	<b>Voice Reconstruction from Brain Signals</b>
		<p>This repository is home to the official implementation of our novel algorithm aimed at reconstructing voice from EEG during imagined speech.</p>
	<b>Key Contributions</b>
		<ul>
			<li> We've developed a generative model capable of extracting frequency characteristics and sequential information from neural signals to generate 				speech.</li>
			<li>Addressed the constraint of imagined speech-based BTS system lacking ground truth voice by employing a domain adaptation method.</li>
			<li>Demonstrated the potential of robust speech generation by training only several words or phrases, with the model showing capability to learn 				phoneme level information from brain signals.</li>
			<li>This work is currently under review for presentation at AAAI 2023.</li>

	<h1>üß† Diff-E üß†</h1>
		<b>EEG Imagined Speech Decoding Using Diffusion-based Learning </b>
		<b>Introduction</b>
			<p>Decoding EEG signals for imagined speech has been a complex task, primarily due to the high-dimensional nature of the data and a low signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
		<b>Key Contributions</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Our study introduces Diff-E, a novel method that utilizes denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and a conditional 						autoencoder to address these challenges.</li>
				<li>We've found that Diff-E substantially outperforms traditional machine learning techniques and baseline models in terms of decoding 					accuracy.</li> 
				<li>These findings indicate the potential effectiveness of DDPMs for EEG signal decoding, suggesting possible applications in the 						development of brain-computer interfaces that enable communication through imagined speech.</li>
				<li>This work is currently under review for presentation at Interspeech 2023.</li>
