function spike = ft_datatype_spike(spike, varargin)

% FT_DATATYPE_SPIKE describes the FieldTrip MATLAB structure for spike data
%
% Spike data is characterised as a sparse point-process, i.e. each neuronal
% firing is only represented as the time at which the firing happened.
% Optionally, the spike waveform can also be represented. Using the spike
% waveform, the neuronal firing events can be sorted into their single units.
%
% Spike data is obtained using FT_READ_SPIKE to read it from a Plexon,
% Neuralynx or other animal electrophysiology system file format containing
% spikes.
%
% An example spike data structure is:
%
%         label: {'chan1', 'chan2', 'chan3'}                         the channel labels
%     timestamp: {[1x993 uint64]  [1x423 uint64]  [1x3424 uint64]}   timestamp in arbitrary units, depends on the acquisition system
%      waveform: {[32x993 double] [32x433 double] [32x3424 double]}  spike waveform, here described with 32 samples
%           hdr: [1x1 struct]                                        the full header information of the original dataset on disk
%
% The example above contains three spike channels, each with varying numbers of
% detected spikes. The timestamps of the spikes are represented, with their
% waveforms (32 samples per waveform). This type of representation can be seen
% as raw spike data, because there is no reference to the experimental trials.
%
% The spike data representation can also represent spike timepoints in relation
% to the experimental trials, as in this example:
%
%         label: {'chan1'  'chan2'  'chan3'}                           the channel labels
%          time: {[50481x1 double] [50562x1 double] [50537x1 double]}  the time in the trial for each spike (in seconds)
%         trial: {[50481x1 double] [50562x1 double] [50537x1 double]}  the trial in which each spike was observed
%     trialtime: [100x2 double]                                        the begin- and end-time of each trial (in seconds)
%           cfg: [1x1 struct]                                          the configuration used by the function that generated this data structure
